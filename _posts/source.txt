Blog Title: operational management through business analytics and data interpretation

Blog Introduction: It is essential for any business to invest in analytical software in order to effectively manage their daily operations. This will allow you to not only understand what is happening within the company on a granular level, but also give you the ability to make changes that can improve efficiency. Business analytics can be used to monitor many different aspects of the business, including sales, marketing, customer service, and human resources. 

for example, if you are a retailer and notice that your sales have been declining for the past few months, you can use analytics to try and find out why this may be. Are fewer people visiting your store? Are they not finding what they need? Are they going to your competitors? Once you identify the problem, you can then work on finding a solution. Maybe you need to run a marketing campaign to attract more customers or train your staff better so they can provide better customer service. Whatever the case may be, without data, it would be very difficult to find the root of the problem.
